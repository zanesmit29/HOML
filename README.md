# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow – Chapter 2

Welcome! This repository features my work from **Chapter 2** of the _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ by Aurélien Géron. All explorations and exercises are performed using Jupyter notebooks for clear, interactive machine learning experimentation.

## 📓 About This Chapter

Chapter 2 dives into the machine learning project workflow with a **hands-on guide** using the California housing dataset. It covers:
- Framing the problem and understanding your data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization and cleaning
- Creating train/test splits
- Preparing data for machine learning models

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chapter_2_notebook.ipynb` | Main Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and notes    |
| `data/`                    | (If present) Contains datasets for local use (optional)       |
| `images/`                  | Saved plots and figures generated during EDA                  |
| `README.md`                | This documentation file                                       |

## 🗂️ What’s Covered in My Notebooks?

- Loading and inspecting real-world data
- Visualizing statistics and geographical data distributions
- Identifying missing values and outliers
- Data preprocessing: clean, transformation, and feature engineering
- Splitting data for robust evaluation
- Preparing data pipelines for machine learning models
- Well-documented code and visual outputs for each step

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hands-on-ml-ch2.git
   cd hands-on-ml-ch2
   ```
2. **Install Necessary Packages:**
   Most workflows need:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
   ```
   (See the notebook’s first cell for a full requirements list.)
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then, open `chapter_2_notebook.ipynb` in your browser.
